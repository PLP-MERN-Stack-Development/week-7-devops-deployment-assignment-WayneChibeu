## Project Overview

**Fitness Tracker** is a comprehensive full-stack MERN application designed to empower users to take control of their health journey. Users can log and visualize their weight, track physical activities, set and monitor goals, and gain insights through interactive charts and analytics. The project demonstrates advanced skills in database design, RESTful API development, authentication, data visualization, and modern React UI/UX.

---

## Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration, login, and JWT-based session management.
- **Weight Tracking:** Log, view, and edit weight entries with units, notes, and timestamps.
- **Activity Logging:** Record physical activities (type, duration, calories, notes) and view history.
- **Goal Setting:** Set and track weight goals, with visual progress indicators.
- **Progress Photos:** Upload and manage progress photos to visually track transformation.
- **Dashboard & Analytics:**
  - Weight trends (line chart)
  - Activity breakdown (bar/pie chart)
  - Calories burned over time
  - Goal progress visualization
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly design with dark mode support.
- **Protected Routes:** Only authenticated users can access sensitive features.
- **Validation & Error Handling:** Robust form validation and user-friendly error messages.
- **Motivational Features:** Random motivational quotes and encouragement.
- **Export Data:** Download weight and activity logs as CSV for personal records.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Backend and frontend tests for reliability.

---

## Architecture & Design

- **Frontend:**
  - Built with React (Vite), Material UI, Chart.js for data visualization, and Axios for API calls.
  - Uses React Router for navigation and protected routes for security.
  - State management is handled via React hooks and context where appropriate.
  - Responsive design ensures usability on all devices.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express.js REST API.
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
  - JWT for authentication, bcryptjs for password hashing.
  - Express middleware for validation, security (helmet, CORS), and rate limiting.
  - Logging with Winston and request logging with Morgan.

- **Security:**
  - Rate limiting on all routes and stricter limits on authentication endpoints.
  - Helmet for HTTP header security.
  - CORS configured for safe cross-origin requests.
  - Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints.
  - Passwords hashed and never stored in plain text.

- **Testing:**
  - Backend: Jest and Supertest for API and logic tests.
  - Frontend: Vitest and React Testing Library (with setup for further expansion).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Material UI, Chart.js, Axios, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcryptjs, dotenv

## Security Considerations
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents brute-force and abuse (global and auth-specific limits).
- **Helmet:** Secures HTTP headers.
- **CORS:** Restricts cross-origin requests to trusted domains.
- **Input Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized.
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed with bcryptjs.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure, stateless session management.
- **Error Handling:** No sensitive error details are leaked in production.

---

## Developer Notes
- **Extensible:** The codebase is modular and easy to extend (add new features, endpoints, or UI components).
- **Environment Config:** Use `.env` files for secrets and environment-specific settings.
- **Testing:** Add more frontend tests as needed for new features.
- **Contributions:** PRs and suggestions are welcome!
